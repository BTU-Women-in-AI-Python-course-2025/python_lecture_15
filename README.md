## 📚 Task: Implement Custom User and Authentication

### 1. Create a Custom User Model:
- Set up a custom user model with fields such as `email`, `first_name`, and `last_name`.
- Use `email` as the unique identifier for authentication instead of the default username.

### 2. Set Up User Authentication:
- Implement a registration form for users to sign up.
- Add login and logout functionality with session management.

### 3. Test the User Model and Authentication:
- Write views to handle user registration, login, and logout.
- Render the forms in templates and handle success or error messages during form submission.
